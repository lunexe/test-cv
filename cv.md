## About Me
I have always been interested in the field of management and I try to improve my skills constantly. I believe that the IT sphere is dynamic and open to new trends and I want to manage IT projects in the future. Therefore, I chose the Project Management courses at Teach Me Skills school. These courses helped me to structure the knowledge and experience that I gained during my studies at BSU and at work.
Thanks to my ability to perceive new information well, I will quickly get involved in the processes.
My hobbies are yoga and film photography
